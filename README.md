# 🎯 Objective
* To analyze a dataset of job listings and identify key hiring trends.

* To detect and handle missing or duplicate data for accurate analysis.

* To explore in-demand skills and technologies across various job roles.

* To visualize job distributions by location and skill sets using charts.

* To filter job listings based on specific keywords like "Python" or "Remote."

* To gain insights that can guide job seekers in targeting relevant skills and locations.

* To lay the foundation for future enhancements like job recommendation systems.
